# snake

This is a classic Snake game implemented in C++. The game provides a simple and interactive interface where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Snake Movement: The player can control the movement of the snake using arrow keys (or other specified keys).
- Food Generation: Food is randomly generated on the game board for the snake to eat.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
- Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body, and the final score is displayed.
- Speed Control: The speed of the snake can be adjusted to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.
